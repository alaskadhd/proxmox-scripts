## FAQ
### Is there any more information available about these scripts?
Of course! Choose one of the scripts above to read a full detailed README and FAQ for each script.

### I don't want to run random Bash scripts from GitHub.
This is understandable. All these scripts are open-source; you can read their source code and judge for yourself if you want to run these scripts. In fact I would encourage understanding what any shell script does before blindly running it! If you have any questions about any of the scripts and what they do, feel free to open a post in [Discussions](https://github.com/roib20/proxmox-scripts/discussions).

If you run into any security issues, please report them in the [Security tab](https://github.com/roib20/proxmox-scripts/security).

If you are not happy with everything a certain script does, feel free to fork or clone this repo and edit it to fit your needs, or open a Pull Request if you think it will help others.

Yes. Please read through [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/roib20/proxmox-scripts/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
