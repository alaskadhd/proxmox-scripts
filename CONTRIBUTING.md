Contributions are welcome. If you notice a bug or another issue, you can either open an Issue or Pull Request. If you have a fix, you can open a Pull Request without first opening an Issue. All contributions will be licensed under this repository's MIT License.

If you have a question or not sure about something, please open a Discussion instead of an Issue.
