# Contributing

Contributions are welcome. If you notice a bug or another issue, you can either open an Issue or Pull Request. If you have a fix, you can open a Pull Request without first opening an Issue. All contributions will be licensed under this repository's MIT License.

If you run into any security issues, please report them in the [Security tab](https://github.com/roib20/proxmox-scripts/security). Please note there is no bug bounty.

If you have a question or not sure about something, please open a [Discussion](https://github.com/roib20/proxmox-scripts/security) instead of an Issue.
